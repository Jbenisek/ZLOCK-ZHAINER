    "The ZecWallet team delivered early desktop shielded support when few others could, bridging the gap between heavy full nodes and early-stage light-client tooling.",
    "Free2Z's founders helped expand Zcash's use cases beyond finance by enabling privacy-preserving crowdfunding, tipping, and creator support built directly on ZEC.",
    "Several independent miners, pool operators, and node runners quietly kept the network stable during rough market cycles, maintaining hashpower when incentives were thin.",
    "Longtime community members like Hanh, artkor, and others contributed code, wallet features, bug reports, and UX feedback that shaped multiple generations of Zcash tools.",

    "Developers working on librustzcash turned complicated cryptographic primitives into reusable Rust libraries that now power most modern Zcash wallets.",
    "Multiple explorers—ZecMate, ZecBlock, ZecScan, and others—were built by independent contributors who wanted transparency tools that didn't depend on a single organization.",
